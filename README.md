# Bone Fracture Detection System

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to detect bone fractures from images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The system is built using PyTorch and includes a set of files for training, testing, and model prediction. Below is the folder structure, its contents, and how to set up the environment and run the project.

## Folder Structure

```

├── .gitattributes
├── .gitignore

### File Breakdown

1. **`.gitattributes`**: 
   - This file is used to configure Git to handle large files like model weights (`*.pt`) using Git Large File Storage (LFS).
   
2. **`.gitignore`**: 
   - Specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git. This ensures unnecessary files (such as temporary or compiled files) are ignored.

3. **`Bone_Fracture.ipynb`**: 
   - A Jupyter notebook used for the training and evaluation of the bone fracture detection model. This notebook can be used to visualize the training process, view results, and tweak the model for better accuracy.

4. **`Datasets_1.zip`**: 
   - A zip archive containing the dataset for training the model. Make sure to extract this zip file before using it for training.

5. **`Fracture_V1.pt`** and **`Fracture_V2.pt`**:
   - Pre-trained PyTorch model weights. These models have already been trained on the fracture detection task and can be used for inference or further training.

6. **`main.py`**: 
   - The main script to run the fracture detection system. It loads the trained models and processes input images to predict whether they contain a bone fracture or not.

7. **`predicted_image.jpg`**: 
   - An image file that contains a sample prediction result from the model. It is useful for testing the prediction functionality.

8. **`requirements.txt`**: 
   - A text file that lists the required Python packages for the project. This file should be used to install the necessary dependencies.

9. **`sample.jpg`, `sample1.jpg`, `sample2.jpg`**:
   - Sample images to test the fracture detection model. These images can be passed to the model to get predictions.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before running the project, it's important to set up a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies and ensure compatibility.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a virtual environment called `venv`.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install the Required Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Running the Project

Once the environment is set up, you can run the project.

### 1. Training (if you want to train from scratch)

If you want to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it, open the `Bone_Fracture.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions inside. Ensure that the dataset (`Datasets_1.zip`) is extracted and ready to use for training.

### 2. Running the Inference

To run the model on a sample image and get a prediction, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py --input sample.jpg
```

This will load the model and process the image to predict if a bone fracture is present.

### 3. Check the Prediction Result

Once the inference is complete, the predicted result will be saved in `predicted_image.jpg`. This image will contain the model's output, which you can review to verify the detection.

## Model Weights

- **Fracture_V1.pt**: The first version of the pre-trained model.
- **Fracture_V2.pt**: The second version of the pre-trained model, potentially more accurate.

You can load these models in the code by specifying the file path to them.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have installed **Git LFS** if you are using Git to clone the repository and manage large files like the model weights. You can install it from [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).
  
- The provided images (`sample.jpg`, `sample1.jpg`, `sample2.jpg`) are sample inputs. You can replace them with your own images to test the model's performance on new data.

## Conclusion

This Bone Fracture Detection System leverages deep learning to automatically detect bone fractures in X-ray or medical images. The project includes pre-trained models, a training notebook, and tools to easily run inference on new images.

### Key Instructions for Users:

- **Environment Setup**: Make sure to create and activate a virtual environment first before installing any dependencies.
- **Requirements Installation**: Use `requirements.txt` to install the necessary libraries.
- **Running the Model**: After setting up, you can use `main.py` to test with sample images or add your own.
